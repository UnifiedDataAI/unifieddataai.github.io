# UnifiedDataAI 

> The Universal Data API designed explicitly for AI Agents and LLMs. 

## Overview
UnifiedDataAI provides a unified, structured API endpoint and NPM package that allows AI agents to securely connect to and consume data from multiple platforms (Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets, Slack, etc.) without requiring developer-written OAuth plumbing or provider-specific SDK wrappers.

## Philosophy
* **Agent-First**: Designed for deterministic and structured agent execution. Responses from different providers are normalized into consistent formats that are highly predictable and easily read by standard LLMs. 
* **Secure by Default**: Agents operate under the principle of Least Privilege. Tokens are encrypted at rest, and permissions are strictly bounded and scoped per user.
* **Plug and Play**: A single NPM package replaces dozens of provider SDKs.

## How It Works
1. **Connect Accounts**: Users authenticate directly via UnifiedDataAI's OAuth flows. 
2. **Unified API Layer**: UnifiedDataAI handles refresh logic, rate limits, and provider integrations behind the scenes.
3. **Structured Access**: Developer's agents make requests via our strictly typed API to query data across connected integrations.
4. **Execution Guarantees**: Actions are taken across platforms with clean permission isolation.

## Technical Details
- Endpoint Structure: REST API conforming to standardized data schemas.
